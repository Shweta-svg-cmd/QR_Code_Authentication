# QR_Code_Authentication
Developed a machine learning model to classify QR codes as original (first print) or counterfeit (second print) using copy detection patterns (CDPs). Leveraging computer vision and deep learning, the model detects distortions from reprinting, aiding in anti-counterfeiting efforts for secure authentication systems.
